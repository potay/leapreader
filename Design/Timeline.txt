Proposed Timeline
-----------------

11/20 	- Basic reading and translating done
		+ May be extremely inaccurate and unpolished as long as rough structure is there
	- Hand Data Collection
		+ In order to analyze data and figure out which filter out less useful data

11/21	- Analysis of data
	- Writing out a few algorithms to test out
	- Write and test out first

11/22	- Analyze results of first algorithm
	- Write basic UI code

11/23	- Write and test second algorithm
	- Analyze results of second algorithm

11/24	- Improve on UI

11/25	- Write and test third algorithm

11/27	- Analyze results of third algorithm
	- Conceptualize machine-learning aspect

11/30	- Algorithm Draft Complete
		+ Includes machine-learning aspect

12/01 	- Work on UI
	- Work on Database Aspect

12/02	- Test on various people
	- Overall tweaking of project to improve it.
	- Start Project Video

12/03	- Finish Project Video
	- Work on project documents

12/04	- Final checks
