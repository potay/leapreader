  What is it?
  -----------
  LeapReader is a sign language translator software which allows users to
  translate pre-determined hand signs into text using Leap Motion device. It
  empowers those who are unable to speak to communicate on a daily basis. Using
  the device, these people can use sign language to communicate as the hand
  signs will then be translated and broadcast to the person they are
  communicating to. For more information on the Leap Motion device, go to www.leapmotion.com.

  LeapReader translates specifically hand signs which are flat, have the palm facing the device and vary in fingers sticking out from the fist.
